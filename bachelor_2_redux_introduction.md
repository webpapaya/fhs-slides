### Recap of Homework

----
### Mutable state

https://codesandbox.io/embed/zqqkxrk14l?fontsize=14

----
### Depending on data which might not be loaded

```js
function getUserName (users, id) {
  let user = users.filter(obj => {
    return obj.id === id;
  });

  return user[0].name; // Might crash if user wasn't found
}
```

----
### God Components

```js
const FormInput = ({ type, ...otherProps }) => {
  if (type === 'text') {
    return <input type="text" {...otherProps}>;
  } else if (input === 'number') {
    //....
  } else if (input === 'email') {
    //....
  }
  //....
}
```
----
### Misc
- use === instead of ==
- you're big fans of console.log debugging
- extra elements in markup
- use mocked data in components
- linting

---
### Functional Programming 101

- Immutability
- Pure functions
- Side Effect

---
## What is functional programming

> Applications developed in a functional style use side-effect free functions as their main building blocks. (Made up definition by myself)

---
## Why functional programming

- More testable
  - pure functions simplify testing
- Declarative APIs which are easier to reason about
- Easy concurrency because of statelessness and immutability
  - State is pushed out of the application core to the boundaries
- Simple caching
  - pure functions easy to cache

---
## Immutability

> An immutableÂ data structure is an object that doesn't allow us to change its value. (Remo H. Jansen)

----
## Immutable objects in JS

````js
const immutableObject = Object.freeze({ test: 1 })
immutableObject.test = 10;
console.log(immutableObject) // => { test: 1 }
````

----
## Changing an immutable value

````js
const immutableObject = Object.freeze({ a: 1, b: 2 })
const updatedObject = Object.freeze({ ...immutableObject, a: 2 });
console.log(updatedObject) // => { a: 2, b: 2 }
````

----
## Unfreeze an object

````js
const immutableObject = Object.freeze({ test: 1 });
const unfrozenCopy = { ...immutableObject };
````

----
## Why immutability

- race conditions impossible
- state of the application is easier to reason about
- easier to test

---
## Side-Effects

> A side effect is a change of system state or observable interaction with the outside world that occurs during the calculation of a result. (Chris Barbour)

----
## Some side effects

- DB/HTTP calls
- changing the file system
- querying the DOM
- printing/logging
- accessing system state (eg. Clock, Geolocation,...)

----
## Where to deal with side effects

- Moved to the boundaries of the system
- Business logic stays pure functional

![Side effects](assets/side_effects.png)

---
## Pure Functions

- A function is considered pure when:
  - for the same input it always returns the same output
  - it has no side effects
      - no mutation of non-local state

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

----
## Pure or in-pure?

```js
const array = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
const fn1 = (array) => array.slice(0,3);
const fn2 = (array) => array.splice(0,3);
const fn3 = (array) => array.shift();
const fn4 = (array) => array.pop();
const fn5 = (array) => array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
const fn6 = (array) => [...array].sort((a, b) => a - b);
const fn7 = (array) => array.map((item) => item * 2);
const fn8 = (array) => array.forEach((item) => console.log(item));
```

----
## Pure or in-pure?

```js
const array = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
const fn1 = (array) => array.slice(0,3); // âœ…
const fn2 = (array) => array.splice(0,3); // ðŸš«
const fn3 = (array) => array.shift(); // ðŸš«
const fn4 = (array) => array.pop(); // ðŸš«
const fn5 = (array) => array.sort((a, b) => a - b); // ðŸš«
const fn6 = (array) => [...array].sort((a, b) => a - b); // âœ…
const fn7 = (array) => array.map((item) => item * 2); // âœ…
const fn8 = (array) => array.forEach((item) => console.log(item)); // ðŸš«
```

----
## Pure or in-pure?

```js
let config = { minimumAge: 18 };
const isAllowedToDrink = (age) => age >= config.minimumAge;
```

```js
const config = { minimumAge: 18 };
const isAllowedToDrink = (age) => age >= config.minimumAge;
```

----
## Pure or in-pure?

```js
let config = { minimumAge: 18 };
const isAllowedToDrink = (age) => age >= config.minimumAge;
```

```js
const config = { minimumAge: 18 };
const isAllowedToDrink = (age) => age >= config.minimumAge;
```

```js
// both are not pure. const saves the pointer. config is still mutable
isAllowedToDring(18) // true
config.minimumAge = 19
isAllowedToDring(18) // false
```

----
## Pure or inpure? 2/2
```js
const config = Object.freeze({ minimumAge: 18 });
const isAllowedToDrink = (age) => age >= config.minimumAge;
```

```js
// freezing the config makes the function pure
isAllowedToDring(18) // true
config.minimumAge = 19
isAllowedToDring(18) // true
```
---

## Summary FP
- Immutability
  - Object can't be changed after its creation
- Side-Effects
  - Communication with the outside world (eg. db, http, ...)
- Pure-Functions
  - returns the same output for the same input
  - simple mapping from a to b

---

### React Hooks

- Introduced recently to reduce boilerplate
- Makes it possible to use state in functional components
  - Previously one had to convert between functional/class components when state introduced
- hooks are prefixed with `use`
- Can't be called inside loops, conditions or nested functions

----
### State without hooks

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 }

  handleIncrement = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>
          {this.state.count}
        </div>
        <button onClick={this.handleIncrement}>Increment by 1</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

----
### State with hooks

```js
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] => useState(0);
  const handleIncrement = () => setCount(count + 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment by 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

----
### useEffect

```js
const SimpleForm = ({ onSubmit }) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  // Is executed when component is rendered for the first time
  // And when the counter variable changes.
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Counter clicked ${counter} times`;
  }, [counter]);

  return (
    <Button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
      {counter}
    <Button>
  );
};
```

----
### useEffect

```js
// Executed on every rerender
useEffect(() => {});

// Executed when component rendered initially
useEffect(() => {}, []);

// Executed when component rendered initially
// and when variable changes.
useEffect(() => {}, [variable]);
```

----
### Other hooks

- [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
  - useReducer
  - useCallback
  - useMemo
  - useRef
  - useImperativeHandle
  - useLayoutEffect
  - useDebugValue

---
### State Management with Redux

----
### What is application state

> An application's state is roughly the entire contents of its memory. ([sarnold](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8102731))

----
### State in Redux terms

> Every bit of information the application needs in order to render.

----
### What information do we need to render this page?

![app wireframe](assets/app_wireframe.png)

----
### What information do we need to render this page?

| Question?                                  | State Name           |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Is the user authenticated?                 | authenticationStatus |
| Is a form already filled with values?      | formValues           |
| Is the input field hovered/focused/filled? | inputStatus          |
| Am I owning money to somebody?             | moneyTransactions    |
| Is somebody owning me some money?          | moneyTransactions    |
| Which users can I owe some money?          | users                |
| Which components should be rendered?       | url                  |

----
### Categorising different types
- Relevant for other parts of the application?
  - add to global state
- Irrelevant for other parts of the application?
  - use component state (useState or setState)
  - also known as UI State

----
### Global/Local/URL?

| State Name           | State Type |
|----------------------|------------|
| authenticationStatus |            |
| moneyTransactions    |            |
| users                |            |
| formValues           |            |
| inputStatus          |            |
| url                  |            |

----
### Global/Local/URL?

| State Name           | State Type |
|----------------------|------------|
| authenticationStatus | global     |
| moneyTransactions    | global     |
| users                | global     |
| formValues           | local      |
| inputStatus          | local      |
| url                  | url        |


----
### Global State
- relevant for other components
- could be seen as a client side database
  - or a cached version of the server data
- domain object should be stored here
  - eg. users, money transactions, authentication token

----
### UI State
- irrelevant for other parts of the application
  - or state which shouldn't be shared with others
- What to store in UI state?
  - Form states
  - visual enhancements

----
### URL State
- defines which set of components should be rendered
- persists on page reloads
- What to store in URL state?
  - the current route
  - the current page of a paginated list

---
### React component tree

![Component Tree](assets/react_component_tree.png)

----
### Storing state in components

![Local state tree](assets/local_state_tree.png)

----
### Storing state in components
- Pros
  - Components are independent
    - eg. "Navigation" doesn't know about "User Update"
- Cons
  - User data needs to be fetched multiple times
  - If UserUpdate component changes name of user
    - Navigation needs to refetch user data

----
### Storing state in the root component

![Global state tree](assets/global_state_tree.png)

----
### Storing state in the root component

- Pros
  - User data could be fetched only once
  - If UserUpdate component changes name of user
    - navigation component is automatically updated
- Cons
  - State needs to be passed down to every component
  - (Root component contains all state logic)

----
### Storing state in the root component

![twitter component tree](assets/twitter_component_tree.gif)

----
### Storing state in redux

![connected tree](assets/connected_tree.png)

----
### Storing state in redux

- Global state which acts like local state
- Pros:
  - Components are independent
    - eg. Navigation doesn't know about UserUpdate
  - State changes are synchronised with the whole app
  - State doesn't need to be passed down the tree
- Cons:
  - "Complex" architecture for small apps

---
### Redux

![redux overview](assets/redux_overview.png)

----
### Why Redux

- Managing state in react can be challenging
  - How to synchronise state between distant UI parts
- Redux provides a predictable way to manage state
- State can only be changed by dispatching an action
- Each action might change the previous state to a new updated state
- Works with react, vue, angular, ...

---
### Actions

![Redux Actions](assets/redux_action_highlight.png)

----
### Actions

> Something happened in the app which might be interesting.

----
### Actions

- An action is data from the application which might be relevant for the store
- Information is sent to the store via store.dispatch

```js
const signInAction = {
  type: "signIn",
  payload: {
    username: "peter",
    password: "the clam"
  }
}

store.dispatch(signInAction);
```
----

### Action Creators

- A functions which creates actions
- With redux-thunk action creators can dispatch itself
  - This is where side effects are handled

```js
const actionCreator = () => (dispatch) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'action1', payload: {} });
  dispatch({ type: 'action2', payload: { something: 'random' } });
  dispatch({ type: 'action3', payload: { something: 'random' } });
  // ...
};

store.dispatch(actionCreator());
```

----
### Async action creators

```js
const createMoneyTransaction = ({ creditorId, debitorId, amount }) =>
  async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'createMoneyTransaction/initiated', payload: {}});
    try {
      const moneyTransaction = await fetch('/money-transaction/', {
        creditorId,
        debitorId,
        amount,
      });
      dispatch({
        type: 'createMoneyTransaction/success',
        payload: moneyTransaction
      });
    } catch (e) {
      dispatch({ type: 'createMoneyTransaction/error', payload: e });
    };
  };

store.dispatch(signInAction({ creditorId: 1, debitorId: 2, amount: 10.3 }));
```

---
### Reducers

![redux overview](assets/redux_reducer_highlight.png)

----
### Reducers

> Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. ([Source](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers))

----
### Reducers

- Specify how state changes in response to actions.
- Pure function
  - input appState and action
  - output next application state

```js
const initialState = {};
const reducer = (previousState = initialState, action) => {
  // do something with the state
  return nextState;
}
```

----
### Reducers

```js
const initialState = [];
const moneyTransactionReducer = (previousState = initialState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'createMoneyTransaction/success':
      return [...previousState, action.payload];
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      return previousState;
  };
};
```

---
### Container components

![redux overview](assets/redux_container_highlight.png)

----
### Container components

- Glue between react and redux
- Provides data from the global store to the components
- Provides "callbacks" to trigger actions

----
### Container Components

```js
import { createMoneyTransaction } from '../action-creators/money-transactions'
const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {
  return {
    moneyTransactions: state.moneyTransactions
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, props) => {
  return {
    createMoneyTransaction: (payload) =>
      dispatch(createMoneyTransaction(payload))
  };
};

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps,
)(MoneyTransactionList);
```

----
### mapStateToProps
- extract data from the store and provides it to a component
- data filtering can be done here
- `function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps?)`
  - state -> the entire application state
  - ownProps -> properties which are passed from other components
- [Docs](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapstate)

----
### mapDispatchToProps
- binds actions with the store and provides those actions to a component
- `function mapStateToProps(dispatch, ownProps?)`
  - dispatch -> the stores dispatch function
  - ownProps -> properties which are passed from other components
- [Docs](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch)

---
## Homework 1

- Implement routing with react router (50%)
  - [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
  - Add the following routes
    - /sign-in
      - Sign-In component is rendered
    - /sign-up
      - Sign-Up component is rendered
    - /money-transactions
      - money-transactions-create component is rendered
      - money-transaction-list component is rendered
---
## Homework 2

- Connect the createMoneyTransaction with the backend (50%)
  - install https://www.npmjs.com/package/compup-api-wrapper
  - read users with `userRepository.all()` and put them in the redux store
    - when the component is rendered the api call is triggered
    - use `useEffect` hook
