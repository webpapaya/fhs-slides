# Klausur

- Theoretical questions
  - What is an e2e test?
  - Is the given function pure? Explain your decision.
- possible coding questions (syntax errors won't count)
  - a redux store is given
    - write a mapStateToProps which returns authenticated user
  - write test cases for given user stories
    - eg. As shop owner I want to receive a list of employees which are older than 18 years old, so I know who is allowed to work sundays.
- I'm not going to ask for curry/compose/memoize implementations, but ask for them theoretically.
